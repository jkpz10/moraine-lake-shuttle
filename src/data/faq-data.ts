    question: 'What is the new Moraine Lake Commercial Vehicle Fee?',
    answer:
      "Starting in 2025, Parks Canada began applying fees to all commercial operators visiting Moraine Lake.

The revenue from the fees charged to commercial operators go directly to offsetting the cost of Parks Canada's traffic management in Lake Louise and Moraine Lake.",
